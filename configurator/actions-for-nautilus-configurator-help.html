		<h1 id="actions-for-nautilus">Actions For Nautilus</h1>
		<p>The Actions For Nautilus extension allows you to add items to the context menu
			(i.e. the right-click menu) of Gnome Files (called Nautilus from here-on, to avoid
			confusion) based upon the characteristics of the files and directories that you have
			selected in the Nautilus window (simply called <em>files</em> from here-on).</p>
		<p>Within the context of the extension, these menu items are called <em>actions</em>.</p>
		<p>You can add two types of actions.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Commands - a command action allows you to execute an arbitrary command, passing
				the selected files to the command as arguments.</li>
			<li>Menus - a menu action contains other actions, allowing you to structure your
				configured commands into logical groups in any way you see fit.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The configuration of the extension is, effectively, the declaration of the menu and
			command actions that you wish to see in the Nautilus context menu for different types
			of files.</p>
		<p>The details of the configuration file itself can be found in the project documentation.
			This help information is intended to help you use the configurator tool to create and
			modify the configuration.</p>

		<h1 id="configurator-layout">Configurator Layout</h1>
		<p>The configurator UI is basically laid out in two columns:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>The left-most column shows you the actions that will be added to the Nautilus context menu.</p>
				<p><img src="images/main-menu-list.png" alt="Main menu list"></p>
				<p>This allows you to: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>see the actions already added to the main context menu, </li>
					<li>easily identify any actions that have been disabled, </li>
					<li>add new actions to that menu</li>
					<li>select an existing action in order to edit its characteristics</li>
					<li>remove all actions from the main menu (which, at the top level, removes all actions from the
						entire configuration)</li>
				</ul>
				<p id="root-sort-debug">It also allows you to set the ordering options for the main menu actions, and to
					set the debug
					output option if you need to resolve problems with your configuration.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The right column shows the details and characteristics of the currently selected main menu action
					from the left-most column.</p>
				<p><img src="images/action-details.png" alt="Action details panel"></p>
				<p>Here you:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>set the type of the selected action - <em>Menu</em> or <em>Command</em></li>
					<li>set the label for the action</li>
					<li>set the submenu items for a menu action</li>
					<li>set the command string, current working directory, and filter rules that pertain to a command
						action</li>
					<li>reorder the action within its containing menu</li>
					<li>delete the action</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Of special note is the <strong>Submenu Actions</strong> tab for menu actions ... this presents the identical
			UI
			elements in a nested format - i.e. the creation and manipulation of submenu actions is exactly
			the same as for main menu actions, performed within the UI presented by the <strong>Submenu Actions</strong>
			tab.</p>
		<p>The instructions below are presented for main menu actions, but the same semantics apply to creating
			actions in submenus.</p>
		<h2 id="undo-redo-and-save">Undo, Redo, Save, and Help</h2>
		<p>Under the title, you will see a row of buttons, the first three of which allow you to undo changes that
			you have made, redo changes that you have undone, and save changes back to the configuration file:</p>
		<p><img src="images/undo-redo-save-json-help.png" alt="Undo, redo, save, help"></p>
		<p>The save button will not be enabled if there are no changes to save, nor if there are problems with the
			configuration. If you have made changes but the save button is disabled, you will need to revisit those
			changes and correct the problems that are reported in order to be able to save the configuration.</p>
		<p>Note that when you save the configuration, it may take up to thirty seconds to see the changes in the
			Nautilus context menu.</p>
		<p>Once saved, the previous configuration is backed up in the <code>~/.local/share/actions-for-nautilus</code>
			folder:</p>
		<p><img src="images/backups.png" alt="Backups"></p>
		<p>You can, of course, restore a previous version of the configuration by replacing the file
			<code>config.json</code>
			with the contents of a backup file.
		</p>
		<p>You are responsible for deleting backups that are no longer required.</p>

		<p>The <code>Show Help</code> button (which you have already discovered if you are reading this) is also present
			at the end of the button row, and allows you to hide this help window once you have shown it.</p>
		<p>And then there is the <code>JSON</code> button...</p>
		<h2 id="json-source-editor">The JSON Source Editor</h2>
		<p>The configurator includes a syntax-checking JSON source editor which, unsurprisingly, is toggled using
			the <code>JSON</code> button in the top button row. This tool is useful for making bulk changes to your
			configuration, such as copy/pasting actions or adding examples from the <a
				href="https://github.com/bassmanitram/actions-for-nautilus/wiki/Configuration-Examples"
				target="_blank">project wiki</a> into
			your configuration.</p>
		<p>When this editor is active, the configuration JSON source can be directly manipulated and the
			main configurator UI is hidden. Additionally, the top row <code>Undo</code>, <code>Redo</code>, and
			<code>Save</code> buttons are disabled (though neither your changes nor your undo/redo history are lost).
		</p>
		<p>When opened, the source editor occupies the full vertical space available to it, though it can be resized
			vertically
			by dragging the bottom border.</p>
		<p>Text manipulation <em>within</em> the source editor uses the same semantics, keyboard shortcuts, and context
			menu
			actions as are found in most web page text widgets.</p>
		<p>JSON syntax errors are highlighted with a red <code>X</code> in the left margin of the editor, and explained
			when you hover the mouse over the <code>X</code>.</p>
		<p>To close the source editor without saving changes, either click its embedded <code>Cancel</code> button or
			click the top row <code>JSON</code> button again.</p>
		<p>To save changes you make in the source editor (and close the editor), click on the embedded <code>Save</code>
			button. If there are
			any JSON syntax issues, you will not be able to save the data and the source editor will remain open. The
			source
			editor itself should highlight the syntax issues.</p>
		<p>Upon successful saving, the editor will close and the changes will be propagated to the main configurator
			UI with any format errors (as opposed to plain JSON syntax errors) notified to you in the normal way.</p>
		<p>Note that saving within the source editor does <em>not</em> save the configuration file itself. Instead it
			simply
			updates the main configurator UI with the modified configuration.</p>
		<p>If, after saving, you need to reverse the changes that you made in the source editor, simply click the
			top row <code>Undo</code>
			button</p>
		<h2 id="action-disable">Disabling an Action</h2>
		<p>Both menu actions and command actions can be disabled by setting the <code>Disabled</code> property to
			<code>true</code>
		</p>
		<h1 id="actions">Actions</h1>
		<p>Actions are what you configure to appear in the Gnome Files context menu. They can be <a href="#menu-actions">menus</a> or
		<a href="#command-actions">commands</a>. Obviouisly menus contain commands - and other menus, though it is probably
		inadvisable to create a menu structure that is more than a couple of levels deep.</p>
		<p>Menus and commands have some global features in common:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>They both have a <code>Basic</code> tab in the righthand pane in which ... well, basic information is entered. In that tab; they share
			the <code>Label</code> field, whose use is pretty obvious!</li>
			<li><p id="action-disable">They can both be disabled!</p>
				<p><img src="images/disabled.png" alt="Disabled"></p>
				<p>When set to <code>true</code>, the corresponding action will not appear in the Gnome Files context menu. This
				   allows the action to exist in the configuration, maybe as a template or a work-in-progress, but not actually be
				   used.</p>
				<p>Note, however, that the action configuration must still be valid in order for you to be able to save the configuration.</p>
				<p>To help quickly identify disabled items, they appear on the left of the UI in grey rather than blue.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>They can be added to, moved within, copied within, and deleted from their containing menus.</p>
				<p id="menu-toolbar">At the top of the menu item list , there is a toolbar.</p>
				<p><img src="images/menu-toolbar.png" alt="Menu toolbar"></p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>The <code>+</code> button adds an action to the menu</p></li>
					<li><p>The paste button pastes an action from the internal clipboard into the menu (it will not be visible if there is no action in the clipboard)</p></li>
					<li><p>The "bin all" button deletes all actions from the menu (after asking for confirmation, of course)</p></li>
				</ul>
				<p id="action-toolbar">At the top of the action detail pane, there is also a toolbar.</p>
				<p><img src="images/action-toolbar.png" alt="Menu toolbar"></p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>The "bin" button removes the action from the menu (after asking for confirmation, of course)</p></li>
					<li><p>The "copy" button (normally) adds a copy of the action to the menu, just below the copied action (and with a modified label)</p></li>
					<li><p>The arrow buttons allow you to move the action up or down within its containing menu</p></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><p>They can be drag/dropped to different positions within their containing menus (but not between menus).</p></li>
			<li>
				<p>Finally, they can be Copy/Pasted or Cut/Pasted <em>between</em> menus.</p>
				<p>Pressing the <code>%3CCTRL%3E</code> button while clicking on the copy action button or the delete action button places the action into the 
					internal clipboard.</p>
				<p>This will then cause the paste buttons in the menu toolbars to become visible. You can then paste the action into a menu (at which point the paste
					buttons will again be hidden)</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h1 id="menu-actions">Menu Actions</h1>
		<p>To create a menu action, do the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>click on the <code>+</code> button in the menu toolbar</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>In the newly-created action details area (to the right), click on the type indicator
					box and change its value to <em>Menu</em>:</p>
				<p><img src="images/action-type-menu.png" alt="Change type to menu"></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You will now see the tabs that are relevant to menu actions:</p>
		<p><img src="images/menu-action-tabs.png" alt="Menu action tabs"></p>
		<p>You will also notice that the selected action in the left column has a new icon:</p>
		<p><img src="images/menu-icon.png" alt="Menu icon"> - the menu action icon - instead of <img
				src="images/command-icon.png" alt="Command icon">,
			the command action icon.</p>
		<p id="submenu-label">You must now give your menu a label, which <em>need not be unique</em> among
			other actions in the
			parent menu to which you are adding the menu.</p>
		<p id="submenu-sort">You can also opt to have the extension sort the actions that will appear in this new menu
			in alphanumeric order (the default is that the order you specify is the one that is used).</p>
		<p>To add actions to your new menu, click on the <strong>Submenu Actions</strong> tab to reveal a nested
			panel that is similar to the top-level UI. Here you can, again, click on the
			<code>+</code> button to configure the actions that will appear
			in your newly created menu.
		</p>
		<p>That is all there is to menu creation.</p>
		<p>Note, however, that your menu will not appear in the Nautilus context menu until you add command actions to
			it, and then only if those commands are pertinent to the files that you have
			selected in the Nautilus window.</p>
		<h1 id="command-actions">Command Actions</h1>
		<p>Command actions are really what this is all about - executing a command string of your choice,
			passing details of the file(s) you have selected as arguments to the command.</p>
		<p>Examples of commands taken from the delivered sample configuration:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Start an HTTP server using a specific folder as the root folder</li>
			<li>Copying details of the selected files to the clipboard</li>
			<li>Running a script file with an appropriate interpreter</li>
			<li>Executing an arbitrary command in a selected folder</li>
			<li>...</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Using tools such as Zenity, Yad, XClip, Gnome Terminal, and others, you can construct complex
			scenarios and even pipelines that are then executed with a simple click on the Nautilus
			context menu item.</p>
		<h2 id="creating-a-command-action">Creating a Command Action</h2>
		<p>You create a command action in the same way you create a menu action: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>click on the <code>+</code> button in the menu toolbar</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>In the newly-created action details area (to the right), click on the type indicator
					box and change it to <em>Command</em></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Upon creating the action, you will see the details that can be specified for the command:</p>
		<p><img src="images/command-action-tabs.png" alt="Command action tabs"></p>
		<p>(as well as a warning that minimal required information has not yet been provided).</p>
		<p id="command-label">Firstly give your command a label, which <em>need not be unique</em> within
			the
			menu/submenu to which you are adding the command.</p>
		<p>And, evidently, you must provide a command line to execute when the action is clicked on.
			We&#39;ll cover that <a href="#commands">below</a>.</p>
		<p>Firstly, however, we&#39;ll cover the rules that dictate if a command action is applicable to the
			current files in the Nautilus selection.</p>
		<h2 id="filtering-rules">Filtering rules</h2>
		<p>Actions For Nautilus can examine the Nautilus selection to decide if a specific command action
			should be available to that selection.</p>
		<p>This examination can apply six different criteria:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The number of files in the selection </li>
			<li>The minimum access permissions that the user must have for the selected files</li>
			<li>The mimetypes of the selected files</li>
			<li>The basic filetypes of the selected files</li>
			<li>The paths of the selected files</li>
			<li>Arbitrary criteria based upon the result of an external command execution</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Firstly note that each of these is optional - if not used, the action applies to a selection
			of any size, any file type, any mimetype, any path, and any permissions.</p>
		<p>It is important to note that <em>all</em> files in the selection must pass the filtering rules in
			order for the action to be shown in the Nautilus context menu.</p>
		<p>It is also important to note that if none of the actions in a submenu are applicable to the
			current selection, that submenu will also not appear in the Nautilus context menu.</p>
		<h3 id="min-items">Min items</h3>
		<p><img src="images/min-items.png" alt="Min items"></p>
		<p>This is pretty simple to explain: the minimum number of files that must be in the selection in order
			for the command action to be shown.</p>
		<p>The default value of this property is <strong>1</strong>. This is likely to be the most common setting
			that you will use. However for an action that, say, compares two or more files, you might want to specify a
			value of <strong>2</strong> here.
		</p>
		<p>As is evident, this property value and the <a href="#max-items">Max items</a> property value are
			coupled.
			If the value of
			<strong>Max items</strong> is greater than its default of zero, then the value of <strong>Min items</strong>
			must be less than or equal to the value of <strong>Max items</strong>.
		</p>


		<h3 id="max-items">Max items</h3>
		<p><img src="images/max-items.png" alt="Max items"></p>
		<p>This is also pretty simple to explain: the maximum number of files that can be in the selection in order
			for the command action to be shown.</p>
		<p>Normally you will be looking at values of either <strong>0</strong> - meaning unlimited (the default) - or
			<strong>1</strong> meaning ... well ... 1. However, other values can be used. For example, for an action
			that compares two files, you might want to specify a value of <strong>2</strong> here.
		</p>
		<p>In this example usage, you might also want to set the value of <a href="#min-items">Min items</a> to
			<strong>2</strong>
			ensuring that the action only appears when two files have been selected.
		</p>
		<p>Again, this property value and that of the <a href="#min-items">Min items</a> property are coupled. If the
			value of
			<strong>Max items</strong> is greater than its default of zero, then the value of <strong>Min items</strong>
			must be less than or equal to the value of <strong>Max items</strong>.
		</p>


		<h3 id="permissions">Access permissions</h3>
		<p><img src="images/permissions.png" alt="Access permissions"></p>
		<p>The optional <strong>Access permissions</strong> rule is used to ensure that you (the user) have at least the
			indicated
			access rights to the selected files.</p>
		<p>There are eight possible values presented as a selection list:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>any</strong>: the default; permissions are not checked</li>
			<li><strong>read</strong>: you must have at least read permissions for the selected files.</li>
			<li><strong>read-write</strong>: you must have at least read and write permissions for the selected files.
			</li>
			<li><strong>read-execute</strong>: you must have at least read and execute permissions for selected files,
				or
				read and navigation permissions for selected folders.</li>
			<li><strong>read-write-execute</strong>: you must have full read, write and execute/navigation permissions
				for the selected files.</li>
			<li><strong>!write</strong>: you must NOT have write permissions for the selected files.
			</li>
			<li><strong>!execute</strong>: you must NOT have and execute permissions for selected files,
				or navigation permissions for selected folders.</li>
			<li><strong>!write-execute</strong>: you must NOT have write and execute/navigation permissions
				for the selected files.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The rule is useful for avoiding actions that make no sense if you don't have the necessary
			permissions for the selected file(s) in order for the associated command to successfully complete.</p>
		<p>For example, if you have an action that <a
				href="https://github.com/bassmanitram/actions-for-nautilus/wiki/Configuration-Examples#a-less-annoying-new-document-action"
				target="_blank">
				creates a new document in a folder</a>, it makes no sense to present that action in the context menu if
			you do not have
			permission to actually create files in (i.e. write to) the selected folder!</p>
		</p>
		<p>Or, if your action involves executing a selected file, it would certainly be cleaner to only present that
			action if
			you actually had execution permissions for that file.</p>
		</p>
		<p>The "negative" settings are designed to allow you to present different actions depending on the permissions
			for a selection. For example, presenting a <code>Script actions</code> submenu for non-executable scripts, but 
			avoiding that menu when a script is executable (and thus may appear in a different menu) - you also must always
			have read access when using the negative settings.
		</p>

		<h3 id="mimetypes">Mimetypes</h3>
		<p>With the mimetypes list, entered in the <strong>Mimetypes</strong> tab, you can specify the IANA Media Types
			to which your command action applies. E.g.</p>
		<p><img src="images/mimetypes.png" alt="Mimetype"></p>
		<p>In this example, the <strong>Run in python3</strong> action only applies to files whose mimetype is
			<strong>text/x-python</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>You can specify any number of mimetypes - the selected files must match one of these in order to pass the
			mimetypes filter rule.</p>
		<p>A mimetype can be declared in one of the ways standard to IANA Media Types:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><em>type/subtype</em> - a specific mimetype (e.g. <strong>text/x-python</strong> as in the
				above example)</li>
			<li><em>type/*</em> - all subtypes of a specific type (e.g. <strong>audio/*</strong> for audio files of any
				encoding)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can specify <strong>*</strong> or <strong>*/*</strong> to accept all mimetypes - but since this is the
			default setting
			it&#39;s a bit superfluous to do so.</p>
		<p>You can make a mimetype <em>&quot;negative&quot;</em> by preceding it with an exclamation point to declare
			that NONE of the selected files should be of the specified mimetype(s). E.g.</p>
		<p><img src="images/negative-mimetypes.png" alt="Negative mimetypes"></p>
		<p>In this example, the <strong>Open in gedit</strong> action will not appear if any of the selected files is a
			PDF, an audio file, or an image file.</p>
		<p>You should probably avoid mixing standard (positive) rules with negative rules since the result could
			be confusing, but the algorithm is fairly straightforward: All selected files must match one of the
			&quot;positive&quot; rules, if any, and none of the &quot;negative rules&quot;.</p>
		<p>Note that the effect of this <em>may</em> be somewhat counter-intuitive:</p>
		<pre><code>!<span class="hljs-built_in">application</span>/*
<span class="hljs-built_in">application</span>/json</code></pre>
		<p>will <em>not</em> allow <code>application/json</code> files through the filter, whereas</p>
		<pre><code>!<span class="hljs-built_in">application</span>/json
<span class="hljs-built_in">application</span>/*</code></pre>
		<p>will &quot;correctly&quot; block <code>application/json</code> files while allowing all other files of (only)
			<code>application</code>
			subtypes.
		</p>
		<p>This is a known current limitation of the feature that may be alleviated in a future release to allow more
			specific rules to take precedence over more general rules.</p>
		<p>However, <em>also</em> note that the first of these two examples can be &quot;corrected&quot; simply by using
			only a positive rule:</p>
		<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">application</span>/json</code></pre>
		<p>which automatically blocks anything not matching that mimetype (see what I mean by confusing!)</p>
		<h3 id="file-types">File types</h3>
		<p>With the file types list, entered in the <strong>File types</strong> tab, you can specify the Gnome file
			types
			to which your command applies. E.g.</p>
		<p><img src="images/filetypes.png" alt="File type"></p>
		<p>In this example, the <strong>Start HTTP server here</strong> action only applies to directories.</p>
		<p>The available filetypes are defined by Gnome itself and are, therefore, presented as a selection list:</p>
		<p><img src="images/available-filetypes.png" alt="Available file types"></p>
		<p>You will notice that &quot;negative&quot; versions of the file types are also available - the selected files
			must
			NOT be of such file types.</p>
		<p>The most useful filetypes are likely to be <code>directory</code>, <code>file</code>, and
			<code>symbolic link</code> and, as such, a
			&quot;macro&quot; filetype is available - <code>standard</code> - which encapsulates all three.
		</p>
		<p>As with <a href="#mimetypes">mimetypes</a>, mixing negative and standard rules could be confusing, however
			there is a useful case for such a mix:</p>
		<p><img src="images/mixed-filetypes.png" alt="Mixed file types"></p>
		<p>This configuration specifies all <code>standard</code> types EXCEPT directories - a sensible filter for
			an editor command.</p>
		<h3 id="path-patterns">Path patterns</h3>
		<p>With the path patterns list, entered in the <strong>Path patterns</strong> tab, you can state that the paths
			of the files in the selection should match certain patterns. E.g.</p>
		<p><img src="images/glob-path-pattern.png" alt="Glob path pattern"></p>
		<p>In this example, the <strong>Open in gedit</strong> action only applies to files that are in user jdoe&#39;s
			home
			directory.</p>
		<p>Patterns can be entered as &quot;glob&quot; patterns or regular expressions.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Glob Patterns allow you to specify the following placeholders in the pattern string:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>*</strong> - indicating any number of characters</li>
					<li><strong>?</strong> - indicating any single character</li>
					<li><strong>[abcd]</strong> - indicating any character in the set of characters between the brackets
					</li>
					<li><strong>[!abcd]</strong> - indicating any character <em>not</em> in the set of characters
						between the brackets</li>
					<li>all other characters are literal</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The above example is a glob pattern.</p>
				<p>Globs are simple but limited - on the other hand, most needs can be expressed accurately enough
					using them.</p>
				<p>Note that glob patterns inherently match against the <em>whole</em> path name - so, for example, a
					path of <code>/etc/home/jdoe/myfile</code> would <em>not</em> match the above example.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Regular expressions allow for far more complex patterns to be expressed. It is beyond the
					scope of this document to explain regular expressions, but the extension specifically supports
					the regular expression syntax implemented by Python. Documentation of this syntax is available
					<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax"
						target="_blank">here</a>.
				</p>
				<p>To use a regular expression, precede the pattern with the tag <strong>re:</strong>. E.g.</p>
				<p><img src="images/regex-path-pattern.png" alt="Regex path pattern"></p>
				<p>This example specifies the same rule as the glob example above but as a regular expression ...</p>
				<p>weeelllll - not quite ...</p>
				<p>Regular expression patterns do <em>not</em> inherently match against the <em>whole</em> path name -
					so, for example, a
					path of <code>/etc/home/jdoe/myfile</code> <em>would</em> match this regular expression.</p>
				<p>To make the pattern match only the whole path, you need to prefix it with a carat character and
					suffix
					it with a dollar character:</p>
				<p><img src="images/regex-whole-path-pattern.png" alt="Regex whole path pattern"></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Again, you can prefix the entire pattern string with an exclamation point to specify a &quot;negative&quot;
			path pattern - no file in the selection should have a path that matches such a pattern - and again
			mixing standard and negative rules <em>may</em> be confusing, but may also be useful in breaking down
			complex patterns into simpler components.</p>

		<h3 id="strict-match">Strict match</h3>
		<p><a href="mimetypes">Mimetypes</a>, <a href="file-types">File types</a>, and <a href="path-patterns">Path
				patterns</a> have
			an option named <code>Strict match</code>, whose default value is <code>false</code>.</p>

		<p>Generally, when this is set to <code>true</code>, it causes the extension to apply "strict" matching to the
			files in a
			selection. So, if you select a set of files, while your action may accept multiple different criteria (say,
			multiple
			different file types), all the selected files must match the <em>same</em> criteria (e.g. must be of the
			same filetype).</p>

		<p>
			Technically, this has a slightly different meaning depending on which of the above the option applys to:
		<ul>
			<li>In the case of file types it means that all selected files must have the same Gnome file type.</li>
			<li>
				<p>In the case of mimetypes, strict matching means that all selected files must have the same mimetype.
				</p>
				<p>In particular it does <em>not</em> mean that each file must match the same mimetype <em>rule</em>.
					So for example, if you specify
				<p>
				<pre>
image/*
audio/*</pre>
				</p>
				as the mimetypes for an action, and then select an <code>image/jpeg</code> file and an
				<code>image/png</code> file, without strict matching these files pass. With strict matching they will
				not because,
				although they pass the same mimetype rule, they are not of the exact same mimetype.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>In the case of path patterns, strict matching means that all selected files must match <em>the same
						positive path pattern rule</em>
					as that which matched the first file in the selection list. Note also that it does <em>not</em> mean
					that all files must match <em>a</em>
					same rule. The first rule that is found to match the first file in the selection must match all
					files.</p>
				<p>Additionally, if there are any negative path pattern rules for the action, all files must still pass
					all of those rules</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>Note that with mimetypes and filetypes, you can specify an empty rule set and still set the
			<code>strict match</code> to true in order to effect an
			"accept all files with the same type, no matter what that type is" rule (this trick has no effect on path
			pattern handling)
		</p>

		<h3 id="show-if-true">Show if true</h3>
		<p>And, finally, the most flexible way of choosing whether a command action should be shown for a particular
			file or selection - call an external command to decide!</p>

		<p><img src="images/show-if-true.png" alt="Show if true"></p>

		<p>Simply put, this property allows you to specify a shell pipeline to execute to determine if the command
			action is applicable to the current selection! In this example, we switch to the selected folder, search
			backwards
			for a file or folder named <code>.git</code> and, if one is found, print the line <code>true</code> (and
			nothing else)
			on <code>stdout</code>. I.e. we show the action if the selection is within a GIT repository!
			(<code>find-up</code> is my own script for doing a backward find).
		</p>

		<p>The command is executed by the default system shell, so all shell capabilities are available to you.
			You can use the <a href="#command-line-placeholders"><code>%F</code> and <code>%f</code> placeholders</a>.
			If you use the <code>%F</code> placeholder then the paths of all selected files are passed on the command
			line with each one single-quoted. If you use the <code>%f</code>
			placeholder, then the command is invoked for each file in the selection with <code>%f</code> replaced by the
			single-quoted full path of that file.
		</p>

		<p>Upon return, if the command emits a single line <code>true</code> on <code>stdout</code> then the action is
			included in the Gnome Files menu. If not
			(including any error in execution of the command, or anything else on <code>stdout</code>) then the action
			will not appear in the menu.</p>

		<p>Firstly, obviously this is extremely powerful and can be "piggybacked" upon to produce all sorts of wonderous
			side effects in addition to its prime purpose.
			But <em>DON'T</em>, and if you do, I take no responsibility for unexpected bad things happening!
		</p>

		<p>Secondly, this can significantly impact performance if over used! Selections where you use the
			<code>%f</code> placeholder will result in the command being called
			once for each item - so the larger the selection, the slower the rendering of the menu will be. To combat
			this, all other rules are examined before an
			action's <code>Show-if-true</code> command is executed, so use those rules to eliminate the action for other
			reasons before resorting to the command execution.
		</p>

		<p>For example, if you were to use the above example, and you keep all your GIT repositories in a specific
			directory tree, use path patterns to avoid the
			command being unnecessarily executed for anything not in the GIT repository tree.
		</p>


		<h2 id="commands">Commands</h2>
		<p>And so to the most important part - the command that is executed when you click on an action
			in the Nautilus context menu.</p>
		<p>In essence, the command string is very similar to commands you would enter at a shell prompt
			or at the Gnome ALT-F2 prompt. It is comprised of (normally) space-delimited tokens, the
			first of which is the name of, or the full path to, the command you wish to execute, the remainder
			being the positional arguments to be passed to that command.</p>
		<p>A slightly modified example from the delivered sample configuration...</p>
		<p><img src="images/simplified-command.png" alt="Simple command"></p>
		<p>The command here is <code>gnome-terminal</code> - everything after that is an argument to the
			<strong>gnome-terminal</strong> command ... except that this is a bit special - the <code>--</code> argument
			actually
			tells <strong>gnome-terminal</strong> that everything after <em>that</em> is a command line to be executed
			once the
			<strong>gnome-terminal</strong> window is open.
		</p>
		<p>So here, when you click on the action, the extension will execute <code>gnome-terminal</code> and pass
			the rest of the space-delimited tokens as positional arguments. </p>
		<p><strong>gnome-terminal</strong> will open in a new window and <em>itself</em> execute
			the command <code>python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1</code> which starts a python HTTP server,
			listening on the <code>127.0.0.1</code> (or <strong>localhost</strong>) network interface, on port 8000,
			reporting all activity into the <strong>gnome-terminal</strong> window.</p>
		<p>When you close the window the HTTP server stops.</p>
		<p>You can start the HTTP server without <strong>gnome-terminal</strong> - just remove
			<code>gnome-terminal --</code>
			from the command string - but you will see no feedback and you will have to make other
			arrangements to stop the server when you are done with it.
		</p>
		<p>And that is an important point here - you get no feedback unless the command you execute
			inherently provides its own feedback (such as a UI or pop-up, etc).</p>
		<p>The command string is "completed" by expanding <a href="#command-line-placeholders">place holders that
				represent different informational
				strings associated with the selected files</a>. <em>How</em> it is completed is affected by the <a
				href="#placeholder-interpolation">
				interpolation option that you select for the action</a>.

		<h3 id="cwd">Current working directory</h3>
		<p>In the HTTP server example above, you may notice that we haven&#39;t specified which directory the HTTP
			server should
			use as its document root.</p>
		<p>For the python HTTP server, the default root directory is the &quot;current
			working directory&quot; (or CWD) when the command is executed. Reliance upon the CWD is ubiquitous behavior
			in Linux commands. You can specify the CWD for your commands by using the property named <strong>Current
				working directory</strong>:</p>
		<p><img src="images/cwd.png" alt="cwd"></p>
		<p>If you don&#39;t specify the CWD, the setting is &quot;undefined&quot; - i.e. the extension itself makes no
			special arrangements to use a default.</p>
		<p>The glaring problem with this particular CWD is that, on the face of it, the setting - <code>%f</code> -
			is <em>not</em> a valid directory. However, within the extension, it <em>is</em> valid. That particular
			value is a <a href="#command-line-placeholders">placeholder</a> that tells
			the extension to use the file path of the first file in the selection as the CWD ... and, because
			this particular command action is configured only to be available when the selection size is 1 and the
			selected file is a directory, we are guaranteed that <code>%f</code> will always resolve to a valid
			directory from which to serve content.</p>

		<h3 id="use-shell">Using a shell to execute the command</h3>
		<p>Writing shell scripts to be executed by this extension is a prime use case, allowing you to
			implement just about any scenario imaginable and having them available in the Nautilus context menu.</p>
		<p>By default, the extension will attempt to directly execute an action's command via operating system APIs.
		</p>
		<p>This works when executing a shell script too if:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The script file is marked as executable</li>
			<li>The script itself informs the operating system what shell interpreter to use with a &quot;hash
				bang&quot;
				(<code>#!/path/to/shell</code>) stanza</li>
			<li>The script is in a directory that is listed in the environment&#39;s <code>PATH</code> variable, or you
				specify the full path to the script as the first token of your command string</li>
		</ul>
		<p>However, you can ask the extension to execute the command within a shell by clicking
			on the <code><s>/bin/sh</s></code> button that sits at the left end of the command entry field. When the
			button
			is displayed in yellow with no strike-through applied to the text, the command will be executed using the
			system shell.
		<p>In effect, this is <em>similar</em> to prefixing the command string with <code>/bin/sh</code> - but it is not
			exactly the same, since the extension exploits the embedded python capability of executing commands in
			a shell and that is a lot more powerful than simply using a prefix.</p>
		<p>Why would you want to do this? </p>
		<p>Well, firstly, if the conditions above aren&#39;t satisfied, this is the easiest way to execute a shell
			script.</p>
		<p>But this option may <em>also</em> avoid the need for writing a script at all:</p>
		<p><img src="images/pipe-command.png" alt="Pipe command"></p>
		<p>This command string runs a shell pipeline without requiring a wrapper script. It executes <em>three</em>
			commands</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>echo</code>, to write the basenames of all the files in the selection to <code>stdout</code>
				(again, <code>%B</code> is a
				file detail <a href="#command-line-placeholders">placeholder</a>),</li>
			<li><code>xclip</code> with arguments that tell it to <ul>
					<li>Read <code>stdin</code> (i.e. the <code>stdout</code> from the <code>echo</code> command)</li>
					<li>Set the contents of the desktop <em>primary</em> clipboard to that</li>
					<li>re-echo <code>stdin</code> to <code>stdout</code></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><code>xclip</code> again, this time with arguments that tell it to <ul>
					<li>Read <code>stdin</code> (i.e. the <code>stdout</code> from the first <code>xclip</code> command)
					</li>
					<li>Set the contents of the desktop <em>default</em> clipboard to that</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>(Read the <code>xclip</code> documentation for more details about the available clipboards)</p>
		<p>After executing this action, the default and primary clipboards will contain the basenames
			of all the files that you selected. You can then paste them wherever you want.</p>
		<p>Another really instructive example:</p>
		<p><img src="images/env-var.png" alt="Environment variable"></p>
		<p>(You really do have to install Zenity!)</p>
		<p>What does this do?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>echoes the value of the environment variable <code>PWD</code> (which contains the CWD path) to
				<code>stdout</code>
			</li>
			<li>&quot;pipes&quot; that to the <code>zenity</code> command, telling <strong>Zenity</strong> to display a
				window with the
				contents of <code>stdin</code></li>
			<li>and <strong><em>NOTE WELL</em></strong> : <strong>Current working directory</strong> is <em>not set</em>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Obviously, the primary purpose of this example is to show that shell environment variable
			expressions can be directly used... but it also solves the &quot;mystery&quot; of what the CWD of
			a command action is if you don&#39;t specify it - no spoilers; try it!</p>
		<p><em>Most</em> things that you can specify at a shell prompt can also be used in the <strong>Command
				line</strong>
			string with the <code>/bin/sh</code> button active. Simply experiment to find the limits!</p>
		<h4 id="shells">Shells</h4>
		<p>At this time there is no way within the extension to specify the default shell to use when the
			<strong>Use shell</strong> option is activated. The extension uses whatever is bound to the system
			<code>sh</code> command.
		</p>
		<p>In <em>most</em> Gnome environments this is usually an at least minimally BASH-compatible shell, but if
			you are executing a shell script, this particular shell implementation may not be adequate for your
			needs (looking at you, <code>dash</code>, the default system shell in Ubuntu and some derivatives). </p>
		<p>You can overcome this either by rebinding the <code>sh</code> command to the shell of your choice or by
			<em>not</em> enabling the <code>/bin/sh</code> button and, instead, doing the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Make the first line of your script be a &quot;hash bang&quot; stanza</p>
				<pre><code>  #!/path/<span class="hljs-keyword">to</span>/<span class="hljs-keyword">shell</span></code></pre>
				<p>e.g.</p>
				<pre><code>  <span class="hljs-meta">#!/bin/bash</span></code></pre>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Make your shell script executable via the Nautilus file properties dialog (or by executing the
					command
					<code>chmod +x /path/to/your/shell/script</code>)
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>Put your shell script in a directory that is listed in your environment&#39;s PATH environment variable,
				<em>or</em>
				specify the full path to your script as the first token when constructing your command action
				<strong>Command line</strong> string.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="command-line-placeholders">Command line placeholders</h3>
		<p>The command line would be of limited use if it didn&#39;t have access to information about the files in the
			Nautilus selection. As already hinted at, though, it does!</p>
		<p>When specifying the command line you can use a number of placeholders as arguments to your desired
			command, each of which will be replaced with specific details drawn from the files that are in the
			selection.
			Furthermore, the placeholders at your disposal have different &quot;flavors&quot; that affect <em>how</em>
			the extension
			executes the command that you have configured.</p>

		<p>All the command line and <code>cwd</code> placeholders implemented by the original
			<code>filemanager/nautilus-actions</code> project are implemented by this extension, with
			the same semantics:

		<h3 id="placeholder-interpolation">Placeholder interpolation</h3>
		<p>Previous versions of Actions For Nautilus had some deficiencies when it came to interpolating the 
			above placeholders into command arguments, and in quoting arguments and escaping characters to
			make the command execute as expected. The input command line was <em>mostly</em> devoid of characters with special
			meaning to the extension and you could alter the space-delimited tokenization by using <code>\</code>
			characters
			to escape spaces or quotes to include spaces in tokens - and <code>\</code> characters to escape quotes and
			backslashes.
			Here is a full example from the sample configuration, setting the terminal title to a value that includes
			spaces:</p>
		<p><img src="images/full-command.png" alt="cwd"></p>

		<p>This approach wasn't bad, per-sé, but it was incomplete, and
		   lead to errors when file names contained special characters, or complex argument construction
		   was desired (for example, appending a suffix to a file name).</p>
		<p>Note also that such issues should only have affected commands that where executed by the shell. Those
		   that are executed natively should not have experienced these problems, and yet, because of the way it
		   was implemented, they also suffered.
		</p>
		<p>There is now a new way to perform interpolation that should eliminate most if not all of
			the issues with the old way.</p>
		<p>The problem is that this new way will undoubtedly play havoc with command lines that rely
			upon the old way.</p>
		<p>So, you have the option to stick with the old way, and, indeed, this is the <em>default</em> for existing
			actions.</p>
		<p><img src="images/original-interpolation.png" alt="Original interpolation"></p>
		<p>The <em>new</em> way is designed to make it more intuitive to create a command line for an action while
		   correctly handling the escaping of special characters that may appear in file names and paths. You simply enter
		   the command line as you would at a shell prompt treating each token as a single argument. Use placeholders
		   at will without worrying about any <em>internal</em> special characters that may need treating specially. Any
		   <em>explicit</em> special characters you include in your command line should be appropriately escaped if
		   needed, however.</p>
		<p>Previously the command line was scanned for placeholders with every <code>PLURAL</code> placeholder
		   (the ones that handle all the selections at once) expanded in place. That is no longer the case.</p>
		<p>Instead, the command line is split into shell "tokens" similar to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html">Python shlex</a> 
			utility <em>before</em> any interpolation is performed, resulting in a list of tokens that each constitute an argument to
			be passed to the action's command (the first such token being the target command itself).
			Subsequently every token that contains at least one <code>PLURAL</code> placeholder is repeated for <em>each</em> additional item in 
			the selection.</p>
		<p>If the command is being prepared for "native" execution (without a shell) then each token is simply expanded
			as-is according to the place holders within it, and the token list passed directly to the system for execution.
		</p>
		<p>If the command is being prepared for execution in the shell, each token is expanded as necessary according to the 
			place holders within it, with any necessary characters in the file information approriately escaped. Finaly the 
			tokens are assembled into a command string appropriate for passing to the system shell for execution.</p>
		<p>Finally there is a new placeholder, <code>%_</code> that splits a single token found in the command line into two
			arguments for the action's command. Note that, with complex quoting in your command line, the effect of this placeholder may
			be different when using a shell from when not using a shell for your action.
		</p>
		<p>Confused? Well, without treading on the toes of the next section, here are some examples based on a
			selection of two files named <code>no-spaces.png</code> and <code>one space.txt</code>:</p>
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Action Command Line</th>
					<th>Result</th>
					<th>Explanation</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><code>ls %B</code></td>
					<td><code>ls no-spaces.png one\ space.txt</code></td>
					<td>The command is passed two 'bare' arguments, with special characters in the interpolated file information properly escaped</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><code>ls "%B"</code></td>
					<td><code>ls "no-spaces.png" "one space.txt"</code></td>
					<td>The command is passed two double-quoted arguments, with <code>'</code>, <code>\</code>, <code>"</code>, and <code>$</code> characters in the interpolated file information escaped</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><code>ls %B %M</code></td>
					<td><code>ls no-spaces.png one\ space.txt image/png text/plain</code></td>
					<td>The command is passed four escaped arguments: the file basenames, followed by the file mimetypes</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><code>ls %B%_%M</code></td>
					<td><code>ls no-spaces.png image/png one\ space.txt text/plain</code></td>
					<td>Note the effect of <code>%_</code> - the command is passed four escaped arguments: the basename of the first selection, the mimetype of the first selection, the basename of the second selection, and the mimetype of the second selection</td>
					</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><code>ls %B%_%B.backup</code></td>
					<td><code>ls no-spaces.png no-spaces.png.backup one\ space.txt one\ space.txt.backup</code></td>
					<td>The command is passed the basename followed by the <code>.backup</code> basename of each item in the selection</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><code>ls "\"%B\""%_%M</code> (not using shell)</td>
					<td><code>ls "\"no-spaces.png\"" image/png "\"one space.txt\"" text/plain</code></td>
					<td>Similar to the <code>ls %B%_%M</code> example above, except that the basenames have embedded quotes - this might be viewed as the <code>%_</code> placeholder behaving as expected.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><code>ls "\"%B\""%_%M</code> (using a shell)</td>
					<td><code>ls "\"no-spaces.png\"" "\"one space.txt\"" image/png text/plain</code></td>
					<td>Similar to the <code>ls %B %M</code> example above, except that the basenames have embedded quotes - this might be viewed as the <code>%_</code> placeholder NOT behing as expected.
					This is due to internal constraints when constructing a properly escaped command line for the shell. However, note that you would normally not need to resort to this kind of complex
				    quoting because the extension now properly handles escaping of interpolated file information correctly for the context in which the placeholders are used.</td>

		<p>The new method is the default for <em>new</em> actions:</p>
		<p><img src="images/improved-interpolation.png" alt="Improved interpolation"></p>
		<p>and, of course, can be activated for existing actions once you have made the appropriate adjustments to the command line</p>

		<h3 id="execution-behavior">Execution behavior</h3>
		<p>The <code>filemanager/nautilus-actions</code> project implemented a feature whereby a
			configured command could be executed once only, regardless of the number items
			in the selection, or once for each item in the selection.</p>
		<p>This extension implements the same feature with the same semantics.</p>
		<p>The decision as to which mode is desired is based upon the first placeholder
			found in the command line for the activated action:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the placeholder has a <code>Repetition</code> property of <code>SINGULAR</code>, the command is
				executed once for each item in the selection.</li>
			<li>If the placeholder has a <code>Repetition</code> property of <code>PLURAL</code>, the command is
				executed once only.</li>
			<li>If the placeholder has a <code>Repetition</code> property of <code>ANY</code>, then the <em>next</em>
				placeholder is examined.</li>
			<li>If no placeholder with a <code>SINGULAR</code> or <code>PLURAL</code> repetition value is found in
				the command, then the command is executed only once.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Additionally, if the command is to be executed once for each item in the
			selection then any placeholder with a <code>Repetition</code> value of <code>SINGULAR</code> is
			resolved to the corresponding value for the selected item for which the command
			is being executed.</p>
		<p>Placeholders with <code>Repetition</code> values that are not <code>SINGULAR</code> are resolved to
			their full values for each execution of the command.</p>
		<h4 id="an-example">An example</h4>
		<p>This example is taken directly from the <code>filemanager/nautilus-actions</code> project
			documentation:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Say the current folder is <code>/data</code>, and the current selection contains the

				successively run:</p>

<span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> paul
<span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> jacques</code></pre>
			<p>This is because <code>%b</code> marks a SINGULAR parameter. The command is then run once
				for each of the selected items.</p>
			<p>Contrarily, if we have requested <code>echo %B</code>, then the following command will
				be run:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> pierre paul jacques</code></pre>
			<p>This is because <code>%B</code> marks a PLURAL parameter. The command is then run only
				once, with the list of selected items as arguments.</p>
			<p>If we have requested <code>echo %b %B</code>, then the following commands will be
				successively run:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> pierre pierre paul jacques
<span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> paul pierre paul jacques
<span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> jacques pierre paul jacques</code></pre>
			<p>This is because the first relevant parameter is <code>%b</code>, and so the command
				is run once for each selected item, replacing at each occurrence the <code>%b</code>
				parameter with the corresponding item. The second parameter is computed and
				added as arguments to the executed command.</p>
			<p>And if we have requested <code>echo %B %b</code>, then the following command will be
				run:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> pierre paul jacques pierre</code></pre>
			<p>This is because the first relevant parameter here is <code>%B</code>. The command is
				then run only once, replacing <code>%B</code> with the space-separated list of
				basenames. As the command is only run once, the <code>%b</code> is substituted only once
				with the (first) basename.</p>
